# MyAnimeList-Web-Scraper-Project

This project uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape anime entries off a users MyAnimeList and extracts information about it.

Future updates include adding the status of the anime for the user (Watching, Completed, etc.), as well as implementing a database to save the information to.
